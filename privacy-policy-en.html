    <h1>UNSEEN Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>
    <p>Welcome to UNSEEN (the "App" or "we"). We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, share, and protect your personal information, and what rights you have.</p>
    <p>Please read this policy carefully before using the App.</p>
    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to the UNSEEN mobile application and related services. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>2.1 Information You Provide</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information</strong>: Email, password, username, display name, avatar, cover image, bio, gender, location, and similar data provided during registration.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party login</strong>: When signing in with Apple, Google, or Facebook, we may receive email, name, avatar, and similar data you authorize (Apple Sign In allows hiding your email).</li>
    <li><strong>User-generated content</strong>: Events, spots, works, collections, comments, direct messages, bookmarks, likes, follow relationships, and similar content you publish.</li>
    <li><strong>Event registration</strong>: Contact details and registration information you provide when participating in events.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2.2 Information We Collect Automatically</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Device information</strong>: Device model, operating system version, app version, for compatibility and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li><strong>Location</strong>: With your permission, for nearby events, map positioning, weather, and localized recommendations ("While Using" or "Always").</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: Browsing history, search history (stored locally), interaction behavior (likes, comments, bookmarks, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2.3 Media and Storage</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera and photo library</strong>: With your permission, for capturing, selecting, and uploading photos and videos.</li>
    <li><strong>Uploaded content</strong>: Images and videos are compressed before uploading to our cloud storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to: provide, maintain, and improve our services; create and manage your account; show nearby events, personalized recommendations, and localized content; process subscriptions, purchases, and membership benefits;</p>
    <p>send important notices (e.g., account security, service changes) and interaction notifications you opt in to (likes, comments, follows, etc.); handle reports and maintain community order;</p>
    <p>and comply with laws and respond to lawful requests from government or judicial authorities.</p>
    <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share or disclose it only: with your explicit consent; with service providers (cloud storage, authentication, database, weather API, etc.) subject to confidentiality;</p>
    <p>to fulfill legal obligations or respond to lawful requests;</p>
    <p>or to protect the legal rights, safety, or property of us, our users, or the public.</p>
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses Supabase (backend, auth, storage, real-time), Apple Sign In, Google Sign In, Facebook (if enabled), Weather API, and Apple App Store / StoreKit.</p>
    <p>Each has its own privacy policy; we recommend reviewing them.</p>
    <h2>6. Location Information</h2>
    <p>Location is used for nearby events, maps, weather, and recommendations. You can revoke location permission in system settings at any time; some features may then be limited.</p>
    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard measures including encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS), access control, and secure storage. We cannot guarantee absolute security; please keep your password secure and do not share it.</p>
    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data necessary to provide services while your account is active. After account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable period, except where retention is required by law.</p>
    <p>Local data (e.g., search history) can be cleared in the app or removed when the app is uninstalled.</p>
    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Under applicable law, you have rights to: <strong>access</strong> (view account and profile in Settings); <strong>correction</strong> (edit profile and preferences); <strong>deletion</strong> (request account deletion in the app); <strong>export</strong> (contact us for a copy of your data);</p>
    <p><strong>withdraw consent</strong> (revoke location, camera, photo permissions, or sign out); and <strong>complaint</strong> (lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority).</p>
    <p>EU/UK users also have rights to object, restrict processing, and data portability. California users have CCPA rights (know, access, delete, non-discrimination).</p>
    <h2>10. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the higher age in your jurisdiction). If we discover we have collected personal information from a child, we will delete it promptly.</p>
    <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be transferred to and stored on servers outside your country or region. We take appropriate measures to ensure such transfers comply with applicable law.</p>
    <h2>12. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via in-app notice or the updated policy page. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
